Hi! I'm Zack, here is my project.

This was my first time using Typescript with React (I used it a long time ago with Angular 2) and Material UI. Maybe a bold choice, but I know that your teams use them so I wanted to give it a shot. You'll probably be able to spot my Typescript blunders (I used any a few more times than I'd like...), but hopefully it's ok :).

Anyways, install all dependencies with yarn or npm

```yarn```

```npm install```

and then simply run

```yarn run serve```

to deploy the fake JSON api and the app.

Zack
